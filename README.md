# Three in Arrow
This project is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Vue.js, Css and the Vuetify and SweetAlert2 libraries.

## Description
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game. The goal is to place three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent. If neither player manages to win, both lose, and the game resets.

## Technologies Used
- **Vue.js:** The game is developed using the Vue.js framework to build a reactive and efficient user interface.
- **Vuetify:** Vuetify is used as a component library to enhance the appearance and user experience.
- **SweetAlert2:** SweetAlert2 is integrated to display attractive messages and alerts.
